  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Hey again! My name is Graham Hagenah. I grew up in Massachusetts (more specifically, the Berkshires) and moved to New York City in early 2023. I'm currently working as a freelance web developer and looking for full-time web development roles.</p>
  <p>I specialize in the front-end, but I'm comfortable working across the full-stack. I love collaborating with talented designers, but I don't shy away from creating my own visuals.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>My most recent role involved building websites and applications for <a href="/projects/predictive-index/">The Predictive Index</a>, a Westwood-based tech company creating personality and cognitive evaluations for the workplace.</p>
  <p>Before that, I worked at the Concord-based web agency, <a href="/projects/bartlett/">Bartlett Interactive</a> - first as a summer intern, then transitioning into a full-time role building websites for local nonprofits.</p>
  <p>Throughout the years, I've worked as a freelance web developer. I'll build websites and applications with static-site generators like <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a>, fully-featured Content Management Systems like WordPress, and powerful libraries like React. <strong>I'm open to work!</strong>
  <p>I've also worked as a graphic designer for the University of Massachusetts where I created multimedia visuals for print and web.</p>
  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2018 with a degree in <em>Multimedia Informatics</em> - a Bachelor of Science degree combining Computer Science, Art, and Marketing.</p>
  <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
  <p>You're likely to find me projecting routes at the rock gym, practicing yoga, reading speculative fiction, and watching movies with friends. If you have any questions or just want to get in touch, <a href="mailto:gwhagenah@gmail.com"> send me an email.</a></p>
