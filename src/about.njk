  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey again! My name is Graham Hagenah. I grew up in Western Massachusetts and moved to New York City in early 2023. I'm currently working as a freelance web developer and looking for full-time front-end development roles.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>My most recent role involved building websites and applications for The Predictive Index, a Boston-based tech company that creates personality and cognitive evaluations for the workplace. I primarily worked in the marketing department, collaborating with designers, copywriters, creative directors, and analysts to build the company's digital presence.</p>
  <p>Before that, I worked at the Concord-based web agency, Bartlett Interactive - first as a summer intern, then transitioning into a full-time role building websites for many local nonprofits. I had the opportunity to build each project from the beginning, making decisions on the tech stack, managing the timeline and budget, and owning the relationship with each client.</p>
  <p>I've also interned as a graphic designer for the University of Massachusetts, Amherst where I created multimedia designs for print and web.</p>
  <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
  <p>You're likely to find me projecting routes at the rock gym, practicing yoga, reading speculative fiction, and watching horror movies with friends.</p>
