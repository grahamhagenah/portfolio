  # About me
  I'm Graham Hagenah, a full-stack web developer who builds fast, accessible, content‑friendly websites. I work across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and WordPress, focusing on clean UX and maintainable front-end systems.

  I earned a B.S. in Multimedia Informatics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2018, blending computer science, design, and marketing.
