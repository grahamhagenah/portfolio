## How It Works
Markdown Slides is a markdown editor at its core, using features and APIs from the [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown-editor-lite) npm package. With help from a parser, I wrote code to extract markdown from the editor and split the text into distinct slides in a deck. Slides are defined using headers, and users can swap between the slides using the legend in the left-most column.

## Future Updates
For now, the only way to swap between slides is to select headings from the legend. Iâ€™ll be implementing slide controls and full-screen previews to enable the basics of a presentation tool.
