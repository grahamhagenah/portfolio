intro:
  summary: From June 2019 to February 2021, I worked at Bartlett Interactive, a digital agency, building websites for nonprofits in the Greater Boston area. Collaborating with designers, project managers, senior developers, and a wide variety of clients, I honed my technical skills and learned about the broader operations of the business.

In Spring 2019, I was out of university and planning the next steps in my career. At the time, I only had experience building web applications in the classroom - everything from wire-framing to user-interface development, but only in the context of school projects. I needed experience solving problems in the real world, for real people. My summer internship at Bartlett Interactive was a perfect opportunity to get the creative, hands-on experience I was looking for post-graduation.

My first day on the job, I shadowed our eponymous founder as he pitched digital services to the Brookline Arts Center. The nonprofit wanted to invest in a new website to let locals to sign up for pottery classes and read about community events - and the editors wanted to have control over the content. Over the next few weeks, I worked closely with the leaders of the arts center to design and build a new website with a bespoke WordPress theme, tuned to their needs and specifications. They were pleased with the final product:

> The resulting website is so easy to use - both for people visiting the site and for us to keep the content up to date. We are so pleased with our new website, and editing it has been a pleasure! We are still getting rave reviews about the great new design from teachers and donors who use the site.

Once I was offered a full-time position at the agency, I took on several more projects and additional responsibilities. To keep costs low and reduce overhead, I began managing my own projects, learning to pitch my own capabilities to prospective clients, forge relationships with key stakeholders, create action plans, estimate costs, and launch products on time and under-budget. I was a developer first and foremost, but eager to hone my business skills along the way.
