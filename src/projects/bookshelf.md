## How It Works
Lend is a web application built using the full-stack JavaScript framework, Remix. The social netwroking features like adding friends and reqesting books are all handled through database interactions with Prisma. 

The app gets data from the Open Library API, a public source for titles, descriptions, summaries, book covers, and more. 

## Purpose
Lend is meant to encourage the exhange of books between friends, and to allow users to share their libraries with other over the web. The books we own say a lot about who we are and what we value, and I wanted to give users an easy way to display their collections for others to peruse.

I also believe applications like these can facilitate in-person interactions and give users unique insights into the personal lives of others.
