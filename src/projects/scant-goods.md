intro:
  summary: While living with roommates, I wanted a simple, cross-platform solution for keeping track of grocery needs in a collaborative way. This application allows users to create groups and edit a shared checklist that's always up-to-date. Info for each item is available, so it's always clear who bought the milk this week.

## Stack Description

Remix provides a powerful and efficient platform for building full-stack applications, with a focus on developer productivity, code quality, performance, security, and testing. As someone who primarily works with JavaScript and front-end technologies, it felt empowering to be in control of the full-stack. Remix makes it easy to interact with the server to get data into components. I didn't have to worry about keeping client-side state in sync with the server. By setting state with mutations, the loaders take over to refetch the most up-to-date data and make updates to your component views. Remix is a perfect tool for applications with highly interactive user interfaces like this one.
