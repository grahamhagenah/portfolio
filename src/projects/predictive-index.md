intro:
  summary: From *March 2021 to August 2022*, I worked at The Predictive Index, a remote-first, psychometric-testing company building software for analyzing the behaviors and motivations of individuals and their teams as a whole. Developing web solutions in cross-functional teams, I deepened my collaborative coding skills, pushed my knowledge of the full-stack, and learned to advocate for accessibility in a fast-paced, results-driven environment.
