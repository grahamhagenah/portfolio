    <p></p><p>From <em>June 2019 to February 2021</em>, I worked at Bartlett Interactive, a digital agency, building websites for nonprofits in the Greater Boston area. Collaborating with designers, project managers, senior developers, and a wide variety of clients, I honed my technical skills and learned about the broader operations of the business.</p>

  <h2>Joining Bartlett Interactive</h2>
<p>In the Spring of 2019, I was out of university and planning the next steps in my career. At the time, I only had experience building web applications in the classroom - everything from wire-framing to user-interface development, but only in the context of school projects. I needed experience solving problems in the real world, for real people. My summer internship at Bartlett Interactive was a perfect opportunity to get the creative, hands-on experience I sought post-graduation.</p>
<p>On my first day on the job, I shadowed our eponymous founder as he pitched digital services to the Brookline Education Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the city's commitment to excellence in public education. The directors wanted to invest in a new digital home to streamline donations, support community participation, and accept grant applications for innovative learning programs.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I worked closely with the directors and volunteers to design and build a new website with a bespoke WordPress theme tuned to their needs and specifications. They were pleased with the final product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The resulting website is so easy to use - both for people visiting the site and for us to keep the content up to date. We are so pleased with our new website, and editing it has been a pleasure! We are still getting rave reviews about the great new design from teachers and donors who use the site.&quot;</p>
<p>— <strong>Brenda Sullivan</strong>, Associate Director, Brookline Education Foundation</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Building Websites for the Community</h2>
<p>Once the principal offered me a full-time position at the agency, I undertook several more projects and additional responsibilities. To keep costs low and reduce overhead, I began self-managing my projects, learning to pitch my capabilities to prospective clients, forge relationships with key stakeholders, create action plans, estimate costs, and launch products on time and under budget. I was a developer first and foremost, but eager to hone my business skills along the way.</p>

<p>Some other clients I worked for include the Charlotte &amp; William Bloomberg Medford Public Library, Lucius Beebe Memorial Library, Brookline Arts Center, Somerville Public Library, Brookline Innovation Fund, Cognoa, Go Healthcare Staffing, and Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership — organizations that I felt were making a positive impact on public health and education. I'm proud to have made my contributions to get them onto the web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I’m thrilled how my website turned out. Working with Graham was a real pleasure. He is an exceptionally good listener and designer. And most importantly to me, he is a wonderful teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>— <strong>Linda Booth Sweeney</strong>, Award-Winning Author &amp; Educator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't overstate the importance of my time at Bartlett Interactive. I began with little real-world development experience. In two years, I cultivated a set of technical, business, collaborative, and creative expertise that laid the foundation for the rest of my career.</p>
