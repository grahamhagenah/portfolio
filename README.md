## Here's How It All Works
If it's been a while since you touched this, here's a reminder of the basics.

### Run Eleventy
We can use the npx command (also provided by Node.js) to run our local project's version of Eleventy. Letâ€™s make sure our installation went okay and try to run Eleventy:

```npx @11ty/eleventy```

### Gaze upon your templates
Use --serve to start up a hot-reloading local web server.

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve```

### Updating content
Update content and templates from the /src directory, not /_site which is where the build files are created.

### Deploying site
When you're redy to deploy, run the build command to generate documents in the _site directory, then push to the repository.

```npm run build ```
