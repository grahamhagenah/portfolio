### RUN ELEVENTY
We can use the npx command (also provided by Node.js) to run our local project's version of Eleventy. Letâ€™s make sure our installation went okay and try to run Eleventy:

```npx @11ty/eleventy```

### GAZE UPON YOUR TEMPLATES
Use --serve to start up a hot-reloading local web server.

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve```
